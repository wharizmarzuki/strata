You are a senior frontend engineer.

Goal: Convert the attached SVG design into a pixel-perfect Next.js (React) website that is interactive.
Hard rule: Do NOT embed the SVG (no <img>, no inline <svg> render of the original). Rebuild it using real HTML elements (div/button/input), CSS (or Tailwind), and React components.

Tech:
- Next.js: [App Router|Pages Router]
- Styling: [Tailwind|CSS Modules]
- TypeScript: yes
- Target layout: 1:1 with the SVG at 1440x900. Use a centered container with exact px sizes.
- Responsiveness: keep 1:1 on desktop; on smaller screens scale down proportionally (CSS transform scale) OR provide breakpoints.

Interactivity requirements:
- Any element that looks like a button must be <button> and clickable.
- Hover states: [describe]
- Navigation: [e.g., clicking "Pricing" goes to /pricing]
- Form elements: [e.g., email input validates]
- Animations: [optional]

SVG element-to-component mapping (use ids from the SVG):
- #btnPrimary -> <PrimaryButton> opens modal "signup"
- #navHome -> link to "/"
- #cardFeature1 -> hover raise + shadow
- #inputEmail -> controlled input with validation

Deliverables:
1) Create a Next.js project structure with /app (or /pages), components/, styles/
2) Implement components with semantic HTML and accessibility (aria-label where needed)
3) CSS/Tailwind that matches the SVG spacing, fonts, colors, border radius, shadows
4) A README with how to run and where to edit mapping

Start by parsing the SVG: list its main groups, ids, and text nodes, then propose a component breakdown. After that, generate the actual code files.
Additional criteria:
- All visible copy must match the text extracted from `img/Utama.pdf`.
- Use image fills sourced from the `img` folder (no embedded/base64 images).
- Keep the 1440x5366 artboard layout and element positions aligned to the PDF reference.
